# Local generated site
Generating [www.pwzxxm.com](www.pwzxxm.com) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

## Explanation
Since github pages runs Jekyll in safe mode and does not support plugins. We need to generate the site locally, copy all files to the actual repository ([pwzxxm.github.io](https://github.com/PwzXxm/PwzXxm.github.io)), cut the files under  *_site* folders to the root path of the repository, touch *.nojekyll* to disable github to generate the site and finally commit all changes.
